IAD position calculator

This is an IAD position calculator for [IAD model].
It takes inputs from the user and calculates the IAD blade & address (e.g. 1/1 or 2/24)
relative to a 10 pair krone block on a vertical & starting range that you specify (e.g. A, 201 or B, 301).

The positions are added to a .txt file and named IAD_[the name of your IAD here].txt

I made this as a bash script based of a Python3 code I made earlier.
